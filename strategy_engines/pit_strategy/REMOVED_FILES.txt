Files removed from pit_strategy/ directory on 2025-12-23:

These files were removed as they were not integrated into any active codebase:

1. __init__.py
2. double_stack_risk_strategy.py
3. overcut_strategy.py
4. pit_loss_strategy.py
5. pit_window_strategy.py
6. undercut_strategy.py

Reason: Dead code - never imported or used by any API endpoints or engines.
The functionality is now consolidated in ../pit_strategy_simulator.py
