Files removed from calculations/ directory on 2025-12-23:

These files/subdirectories were removed as they were not integrated into any active codebase:

1. __init__.py
2. car/ (subdirectory)
3. driver/ (subdirectory)
4. race_state/ (subdirectory)
5. track/ (subdirectory)
6. traffic/ (subdirectory)
7. tyre/ (subdirectory)
8. weather/ (subdirectory)

Reason: Dead code - never imported or used by any API endpoints or engines.
Calculation functionality exists in ../calculation_engines/ instead.
